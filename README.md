#To-do Application#

Estimate: 6 person-hours

Date of last deployment commit/push: Thursday, 9/25, 9pm. 

###Functional specifications:###

1. Basic application in a nutshell - todo app - list of tasks, checked off when completed
2. When checked, each task should be grayed-out and struck-through
3. Complementary color palette in either Spring or Fall tones
4. Come up with a name 
5. Design a cool logotype
6. Very legible on mobile
7. Tasks can be long
8. Enter tasks in a form
	0. the form has a way of entering a string
	1. The form must respond to a button, which enters the form string into the task list
	2. it would be nice to enter the task into the list using the ENTER key
	3. The form should be at the top of the list
	4. It would be nice, if, on a phone, the form stayed at the bottom of the screen.
9. A task is a string and a completion status (checkbox). 
10. It would be nice to have a delete button on each task. The delete button makes the task disappear forever. Undo is not required.
11. There's no limit to the number of tasks
12. The list must be vertical, no numbers or bullets. List appears in order of entry.
13. It would be nice to try both newest-first and oldest first and decide.
14. No drag and drop (yet). No grouping. No flags.
