*To-do Application*

Estimate of how many person-hours: 

Date of last deployment commit/push: Thursday, 9/25, 9pm. 

Functional specifications:

1. Basic application in a nutshell - todo app - list of tasks, checked off when completed
2. when checked, each task should be grayed-out and struck-through
3. I want a complementary color palette in either Spring or Fall tones
4. Surprise me with a name
5. I'd like a cool logotype
6. I want the task list very legible on mobile
7. tasks can be long
8. enter tasks in a form
	0. the form has a way of entering a string
	1. The form must respond to a button, which enters the form string into the task list
	2. it would be nice to enter the task into the list using the ENTER key
	3. The form should be at the top of the list
	4. It would be nice, if, on a phone, the form stayed at the bottom of the screen.
9. A task is a string and a completion status (checkbox). The client doesn't want a date at this time
10. It would be nice to have a delete button on each task. The delete button makes the task disappear forever. Undo is not required.
11. There's no limit to the number of tasks
12. The list must be vertical, no numbers or bullets. Checkboxis are required. List appears in order of entry.
13. It would be nice if I could try both newest-first and oldest first and decide.
14. No drag and drop (we'll later). No grouping. No flags.
